In this showcase, we explore how to leverage Dependency Injection (DI) to create clean, maintainable, and modular code.

We demonstrate the use of the Strategy Pattern to decouple business logic from implementation details, allowing different components to resolve the appropriate service dynamically.

The example involves a middleware that determines which service implementation to inject based on HTTP headers, showcasing how DI can separate decision-making logic from business logic.

This approach enhances clarity, adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle, and simplifies the registration of services, particularly when using a flexible DI library like Autofac.
